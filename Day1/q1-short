1. What is the role of noise input in Pix2Pix?

      Novel images can be generated by changing the noise input
      Generated images varies constantly with change in noise input
      Pix2Pix generally ignores noise input
      Adding noise vector will reduce the quality of images
      
      
2. What is the main advantage of CycleGAN over Pix2Pix? 
      CycleGAN produces better images than Pix2Pix
      CycleGAN trains faster than Pix2Pix
      CycleGAN is not prone to mode collapse
      CycleGAN does not require paired data
      
      
3. Unrolled GAN solves the problem of:
      Mode collapse
      Speed of training
      Interpretability
      Control of output images
      
4. Match the GAN architectures in terms of functionality

      DiscoGAN
      StackGAN
      BiGAN
      ALI
      CycleGAN
      LapGAN
      ALI
      CycleGAN
      LapGAN
      
      
5. In InfoGAN, why do we have an extra mutual information term in the objective function?

      The diversity of the images produced will be greater
      The network doesn't ignore the structural latent variables during training
      The images produced will be more realistic
      
      
6. What is the loss used in Wasserstein GAN

      KL divergence
      Reverse KL divergence
      Jenson Shannon divergence
      Earth mover's distance
